- The data of this word analogy program is provided by tensorflow and can be obtained [here](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/questions-words.txt), which is a ```.txt``` file about the thousands of analogy word pairs.
- The idea of this program is inspired by the general methods of word analogy from [here](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/Google_analogy_test_set_(State_of_the_art)). However, instead of simply applying the cosine similarity, this program also combines the idea of machine learning ([idea](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C/C16/C16-1332.pdf)).
- The result of the program is commented at the end of the ```train.py``` file.
